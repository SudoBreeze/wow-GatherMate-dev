# GatherMate_Data for RG
Updating the **GatherMate_Data** files for Rising-Gods.

#### Contents
Most of the "relevant" nodes for Mining, Herbalism, Gas, Fishing and Treasure have been added in their respective zones at the coordinates which they have according to the [RG database](https://db.rising-gods.de/?objects). Some nodes have been left out as they are either useless (basic, unlocked chests) or part of rather specific farming quests (Un'goro earth). This updated version should correctly cover about 90% of all relevant nodes in game.

#### Accuracy or Errors
The RG DB only provides 3 significant digits of precision for object coordinates. Some nodes may be a bit off.

*Some* nodes seemed a bit "off" or misplaced in their location so some have been left out as to not add confusing wrong placements.

The Bloodmyst Isle seems to have basically *no nodes* according to the RG DB. I am not sure if that is accurate or an error in the DB.
